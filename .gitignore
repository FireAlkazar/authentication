# There was a discussion about whether we should use a more compact or more
# comprehensive '.gitignore' file. The former is easier to understand and
# review, while the latter can prevent mistakes. We decided to go with a more
# compact version for the time beeing [1].
#
# If you are in the situation that you accidentally commited stuff that did
# not belong into the repository, that would have been prevented by the
# standard '.gitignore' file for dotnet [2], then consider creating an issue
# about this and we can revisit this decision.
